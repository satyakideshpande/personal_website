				<p>
					<h2>Sports</h2>
					I strongly believe in the phase "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". Fitness should be an essential process of everyone's life. Working out daily can reduce stress and anxiety which leads to a happy and peaceful soul.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the most important thing that sports has taught me is to never give up, stay confident and play until the very end.

					<h2>Travel</h2>
					Another one of my hobbies is travelling. To travel from one place to another in different purposes is generally called travelling. People do not travel always in the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. It has much educative value. It is a part of education.

					<h2>Photography</h2>
					Photography is also one of my hobbies.Photography is the whole world full of adventures, interesting events, stories, games of colors and light. As one of the most interesting and exciting forms of art, it appeared a long time ago, and to this time has been greatly influencing the human life
